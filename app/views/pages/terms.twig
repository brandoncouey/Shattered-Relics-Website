                        SR may take action against you, including revoking access to certain or all SR Services, Content or Entitlements,
                    or terminating your SR Account as described in Section 3. In case of severe violations, SR may take these
                    actions without issuing a prior warning. Some examples of severe violations include, but are not limited to:
                    promoting, encouraging or engaging in hacking, selling SR accounts or entitlements without SR permission,
                    extreme harassment, or threatening illegal activities. When practical, SR will notify you of the action it will

                    <h5><strong>3. Termination and Other Sanctions</strong></h5>
                    <p>This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or SR. SR may terminate your access and use of any SR
                    Services or your SR Account if SR determines that you have violated this Agreement or that there has been
                    otherwise unlawful, improper or fraudulent use of SR Services associated with your SR Account. When practical,
                    SR will notify you of the termination. If your SR Account is terminated, you will not have access to your SR
                    Account or Entitlements and may be barred from accessing or using any SR Service again. Upon termination,
                    your license under this Agreement also shall terminate, and all of your listings will be removed. If you have
                    active premium, you will not be refunded in full, or in part.</p>
                    <h5><strong>4. Listing Rules &amp; Guidelines</strong></h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>All information must be relevant to the game server, and may not include anything that goes against Section 2.</li>
                    <li>False or misleading advertisements will result in termination in accordance with Section 3.</li>
                    <li>Images must be related to your listing, and not contain anything that goes against Section 2.</li>
                    <li>Affiliate links are not allowed. Referral links, however, are allowed, as long as there is no monetary gain.</li>
                    <li>Each of your listings must be unique, and not relate to any other game server. Duplicates will be removed
                    and your account may be terminated in accordance with Section 3.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5><strong>5. Use of Data / Data Collection</strong></h5>
                    <p>When using a SR service, SR may collect data from your computer or device, including information
                    about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address), system interactions, and hardware. We
                    do not store this data, and we do not share this data with anyone. We use this information to provide you with
                    the best possible experience on your platform, improve our products and services, and trouble shoot bugs. (mostly
                    the latter).</p>
                    <h5><strong>6. Paypal/Payment Requirements</strong></h5>
                    <p>Purchases made on the website are subject to PayPal's terms of service. A verified account is not required,
                    but highly recommended to prevent issues in the future. The account used to make the purchase must be yours,
                    and in your own name, and owned by you explicitly. All purchases are made in USD currency. Any attempt to
                    dispute the payment wrongfully (such as an unauthorized claim or item not received when it was legit), may
                    result in termination of your account in accordance with Section 3.</p>
                    <h5><strong>7. Changes to this agreement</strong></h5>
                    <p>SR may modify this Agreement from time to time, so please review it frequently. For SR players who accepted a
                    version of this Agreement prior to modification, the revisions will become effective 30 days after posting
                    at rune-nexus.com/terms. Your continued use of SR Services means you accept the changes. Once you accept
                    a version of the Agreement, we will not enforce future material changes without your express agreement to them.
                    If you are asked to accept material changes to this Agreement and you decline to do so, you may not be able
                    to continue to use the SR Service provided.</p>
